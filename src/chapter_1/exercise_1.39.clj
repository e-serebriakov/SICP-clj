;; A continued fraction representation of the
;; tangent function was published in 1770 by the German mathematician
;; J.H. Lambert:
;; tanx = x / (1 - (x^2 / (3 - (x^2 (5 - ....)))))
;; where `x` is in radians. Define a procedure `(tan-cf x k)` that
;; computes an approximation to the tangent function based
;; on Lambertâ€™s formula. `k` specifies the number of terms to
;; compute, as in Exercise 1.37.
