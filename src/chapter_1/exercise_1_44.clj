;; The idea of smoothing a function is an important concept
;; in signal processing. If f is a function and
;; dx is some small number, then the smoothed version of f is
;; the function whose value at a point x is the average of f(x âˆ’ dx), 
;; f(x), and f(x + dx). Write a procedure smooth that takes
;; as input a procedure that computes f and returns a procedure 
;; that computes the smoothed f. It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly 
;; smooth a function (that is, smooth the
;; smoothed function, and so on) to obtain the n-fold smoothed
;; function. Show how to generate the n-fold smoothed function 
;; of any given function using smooth and repeated from Exercise 1.43.
