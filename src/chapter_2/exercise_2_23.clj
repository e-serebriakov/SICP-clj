;; The procedure for-each is similar to map. It
;; takes as arguments a procedure and a list of elements. 
;; However, rather than forming a list of the results, for-each just
;; applies the procedure to each of the elements in turn, from
;; left to right. The values returned by applying the procedure
;; to the elements are not used at allâ€”for-each is used with
;; procedures that perform an action, such as printing. For example,
;; (for-each (lambda (x)
;;   (newline)
;;   (display x))
;;   (list 57 321 88))
;; The value returned by the call to for-each (not illustrated
;; above) can be something arbitrary, such as true. Give an
;; implementation of for-each.
