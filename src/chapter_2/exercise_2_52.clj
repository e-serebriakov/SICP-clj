;; Make changes to the square limit of wave
;; shown in Figure 2.9 by working at each of the levels described above. 
;; In particular:
;; a. Add some segments to the primitive wave painter of
;;    Exercise 2.49 (to add a smile, for example).
;; I don't have it

;; b. Change the pattern constructed by corner-split (for
;;    example, by using only one copy of the up-split and
;;    right-split images instead of two).

;;    so as to assemble the corners in a diï¬€erent
;;    pattern. (For example, you might make the big Mr.
;;    Rogers look outward from each corner of the square.)
