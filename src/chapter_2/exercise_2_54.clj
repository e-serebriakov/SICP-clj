;; Two lists are said to be equal? if they contain equal elements
;; arranged in the same order. For example,
;; (equal? '(this is a list) '(this is a list))
;; is true, but
;; (equal? '(this is a list) '(this (is a) list))
;; is false. To be more precise, we can define equal? recursively
;; in terms of the basic eq? equality of symbols by saying
;; that a and b are equal? if they are both symbols and
;; the symbols are eq?, or if they are both lists such that (car a)
;; is equal? to (car b) and (cdr a) is equal? to (cdr b).
;; Using this idea, implement equal? as a procedure.36
