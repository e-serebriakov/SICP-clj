;; A directed line segment in the plane can be
;; represented as a pair of vectors â€” the vector running from
;; the origin to the start-point of the segment, and the vector
;; running from the origin to the end-point of the segment.
;; Use your vector representation from Exercise 2.46 to define
;; a representation for segments with a constructor make-segment
;; and selectors start-segment and end-segment.
