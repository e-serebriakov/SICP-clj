;; Implement a representation for rectangles in
;; a plane. (Hint: You may want to make use of Exercise 2.2.) In
;; terms of your constructors and selectors, create procedures
;; that compute the perimeter and the area of a given rectangle. 
;; Now implement a diï¬€erent representation for rectangles.
;; Can you design your system with suitable abstraction
;; barriers, so that the same perimeter and area procedures
;; will work using either representation?
